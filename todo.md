# Board Game Rule Master - Development To-Do List

This list outlines the steps to build the Board Game Rule Master web application.

## Phase 1: Backend Setup and Core Functionality

1.  **Set up Backend Environment:**
    * [ ] Choose a Python framework (Flask or FastAPI).
    * [ ] Initialize the project structure.
    * [ ] Set up virtual environment and install necessary dependencies (e.g., Flask/FastAPI, database connector, vector database client, PDF processing library).

2.  **Database Design and Setup:**
    * [ ] Design the relational database schema (games, rulebooks, users - if applicable initially, chat history).
    * [ ] Choose and set up the relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
    * [ ] Define database models/schemas using an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy with Flask, or directly with FastAPI).
    * [ ] Choose and set up a vector database/store.

3.  **Rulebook Processing Module:**
    * [ ] Implement functionality to upload PDF rulebooks.
    * [ ] Implement backend validation of uploaded PDFs.
    * [ ] Implement logic to move approved PDFs to permanent storage.
    * [ ] Implement text extraction from PDF rulebooks.
    * [ ] Implement text chunking logic for efficient retrieval.
    * [ ] Implement embedding generation for text chunks.
    * [ ] Implement storage of embeddings in the vector database, linking them to the rulebook.

4.  **Game Data Model and API Endpoints:**
    * [ ] Define the data model for games (title, description, rulebook ID).
    * [ ] Implement API endpoints for:
        * [ ] Adding new games (initially for admin).
        * [ ] Retrieving game details.
        * [ ] Listing all games.

5.  **Chatbot Logic (Initial Version):**
    * [ ] Implement basic chatbot logic using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
    * [ ] Create an API endpoint to receive user queries for a specific game.
    * [ ] Implement retrieval of relevant text chunks from the vector database based on the query and the game's rulebook.
    * [ ] Implement a basic language model integration to generate answers based on the retrieved context.

6.  **Admin Interface (Backend):**
    * [ ] Implement API endpoints for:
        * [ ] Listing submitted rulebooks.
        * [ ] Displaying details of a submitted rulebook (title, description, PDF link).
        * [ ] Approving a submitted rulebook (triggers processing).
        * [ ] Rejecting a submitted rulebook (with optional reason).
        * [ ] Editing existing game details.
        * [ ] Replacing rulebooks for existing games (triggers re-processing).
        * [ ] Deleting games.

7.  **Asynchronous Processing:**
    * [ ] Implement an asynchronous task queue (e.g., Celery) for background jobs like PDF processing and embedding generation.
    * [ ] Integrate the task queue with the rulebook approval process.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  **Set up Frontend Environment:**
    * [ ] Choose a web framework/library (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, potentially React or Vue).
    * [ ] Initialize the project structure.

2.  **UI Components:**
    * [ ] Build the layout and basic styling.
    * [ ] Implement a game selection interface.
    * [ ] Implement the chatbot interface for asking rule-specific questions.
    * [ ] Implement an admin interface (protected route):
        * [ ] Page to view submitted rulebooks with approve/reject buttons.
        * [ ] Form for submitting new games and rulebooks.
        * [ ] Interface for managing existing games (edit, replace rulebook, delete).

3.  **API Integration:**
    * [ ] Implement communication with the backend APIs for:
        * [ ] Fetching the list of games.
        * [ ] Sending user queries to the chatbot.
        * [ ] Displaying chatbot responses.
        * [ ] Submitting new rulebooks (admin).
        * [ ] Approving/rejecting submissions (admin).
        * [ ] Managing games (admin).

4.  **User Experience (UX):**
    * [ ] Ensure a smooth and intuitive user flow for both regular users and administrators.
    * [ ] Implement clear feedback mechanisms for API calls and background processes.

## Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

1.  **Unit Testing:**
    * [ ] Write unit tests for backend logic (rulebook processing, database interactions, chatbot logic).
    * [ ] Write unit tests for frontend components and API interactions.

2.  **Integration Testing:**
    * [ ] Perform integration tests to ensure different components of the application work together correctly.

3.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    * [ ] Conduct testing with potential users to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.

4.  **Performance Optimization:**
    * [ ] Identify and address any performance bottlenecks in the application.

5.  **Security Review:**
    * [ ] Implement security best practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Phase 4: Deployment and Maintenance

1.  **Deployment:**
    * [ ] Choose a hosting platform.
    * [ ] Configure the deployment environment.
    * [ ] Deploy the backend and frontend applications.
    * [ ] Set up monitoring and logging.

2.  **Maintenance:**
    * [ ] Regularly monitor the application for issues.
    * [ ] Implement a process for updating game data and rulebooks.
    * [ ] Address any bugs or security vulnerabilities that arise.

## Future Considerations (Separate Phase)

* [ ] Implement user accounts.
* [ ] Develop community features (rating answers, suggesting interpretations).
* [ ] Add multilingual support.
* [ ] Explore advanced RAG techniques.
* [ ] Implement visual aid extraction.
* [ ] Integrate with the BoardGameGeek (BGG) API.

This to-do list provides a structured approach to building the Board Game Rule Master application. Remember to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks as you progress. Good luck!
