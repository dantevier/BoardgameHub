# Boardgame-RAG

A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system specialized for board game rulebooks and information.

## Overview

This project aims to create an intelligent assistant capable of answering queries about board game rules by leveraging the power of large language models combined with RAG techniques for better context and accuracy.

## Features (Planned)

- PDF rulebook ingestion and processing
- Vector storage for efficient retrieval
- Natural language query interface
- Context-aware responses based on specific board game rules

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python (FastAPI/Flask)
- Vector Store: Chroma/FAISS
- LLM Integration: LangChain
- Frontend: To be determined

## Getting Started

Instructions for setup and deployment coming soon.
